Prologue: The Drowning Town

They say Blackwater Cove was swallowed by the sea in a single night.

The church bells rang without hands. The streets flooded with water that wasn’t rain. And when the sun rose, the town was gone—sunk beneath the waves, its secrets locked in brine and silence.

But sometimes, when the tide is low, you can still hear the voices.

Chapter 1: The Call of the Tides

Ellis Vaughn never wanted to return to Blackwater Cove.

Yet here she is, twenty years after her mother vanished into the mist, standing on the crumbling cliffs where the old town once stood. The inheritance letter said the family home was hers—but the lawyer failed to mention the house shouldn’t exist.

Because Ellis remembers watching it burn.

Now, its peeling blue shutters stare back at her, salt-rotted but intact. And the note nailed to the door is written in her mother’s handwriting:

"The past doesn’t stay buried here. It rises."

Chapter 2: The Ghosts in the Walls

The house breathes.

Ellis feels it the moment she steps inside—the way the floorboards sigh underfoot, how the mirrors fog with breath that isn’t hers. At night, she hears footsteps pacing the attic.

Then she finds the journal.

Her mother’s entries grow frantic near the end:

"The Cove is hungry. It takes memories first, then flesh. I tried to leave, but the road always leads back. If you’re reading this, Ellis—run."

But Ellis can’t run.

Because in the mirror behind her, a woman in a waterlogged dress mouths two words:

"Help me."

Chapter 3: The Drowning Ritual

The town archives reveal the truth.

Every thirty years, Blackwater Cove demands a sacrifice to stay beneath the waves. A life given willingly, drowned in the old lighthouse basin. Ellis’s grandmother did it. So did her great-aunt.

Her mother refused.

Now the cycle is broken, and the Cove is waking. The tide creeps higher each night, bringing with it the ghosts of those who were lost. They whisper to Ellis in dreams, their voices thick with seawater:

"Finish what she started."

Chapter 4: The Choice

The lighthouse beam cuts through the storm, illuminating two figures on the pier—Ellis’s mother, pale as mist, and a shadowy thing with too many teeth wearing the mayor’s smile.

"One life for a hundred," it croons. "Your family always pays its debts."

Ellis grips her mother’s sodden journal. The last page holds a spell—a way to sink the Cove forever. But the cost?

A memory.

Not just any memory.

The one that matters most.

Epilogue: The Forgotten Shore

A year later, a historian stumbles upon a strange town on outdated maps. When she asks locals about Blackwater Cove, they shake their heads.

"Never heard of it."

But that night, standing on the empty beach, she swears the waves whisper a name—

Ellis.

And far out in the dark, a single light flickers.

Once.

Twice.

Gone.
