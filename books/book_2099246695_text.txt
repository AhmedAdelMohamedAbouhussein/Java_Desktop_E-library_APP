leetcode 150

✔	Vectors (Dynamic arrays) from the Standard Template Library (STL)
✔	arraylist in java
✔	hash maps/tables good for searching less time complexity
✔	merge sort (divide and conquer) Q88
✔	Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find majority element Q169
✔	inplace shifting to rotate array ( shift k times) Q189
✔	count sort Q274
✔	use aray lists and hashmaps for less time complexity O(n) Q380
	sets/hashsets

✔	greedy algorithm:

	1) To find the maximum number of disjoint intervals, the best approach
	is a greedy algorithm that selects intervals based on their earliest 
	finishing times. This is similar to the Activity Selection Problem.
	
	2)largest permutation
	
	3)jump game Q45, Q55
